It looks like this may be your first time running zippy.
I can get you started by creating a $prefs file to store that information.
You need to get a User ID and Passwrod from the United States Post Office's 
Web Tools API. You can get it for free at
https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/welcome.htm
If you have that information we can get started.

Sorry, this program will not work unless you edit it and add a User ID to the $uid variable.
You can get a User ID by signing up for the United States Post Office's Web Tools API at

You will be asked to enter an address to find a zip code.
Note: I have not set this up for Puerto Rico or military locations.

There are arguments you can use.

"123 Address St, [Apt 4,] City Name, ST"    COMMA-SEPARATED address.
  Do not use brackets around the possible apartment.
  This will definitely work better if everything is enclosed in quotes,
  such that bash can split the string into an array.
help      THIS PROMPT.
